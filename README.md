# Fake News Classification

## Description
This project focuses on building a Fake News Classification model using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning. The model classifies news articles as real or fake based on their titles.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to identify fake news by applying various NLP techniques such as tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization, followed by converting text data into numerical vectors using TF-IDF Vectorization. A Random Forest classifier is used to build the model.

### Key Features:
- **Data Preprocessing:** Includes tokenization, removing stop words, stemming, and lemmatization.
- **Vectorization:** TF-IDF is used to convert text data into feature vectors.
- **Model Training:** The dataset is split into training and testing sets, with the model being trained using Random Forest.
- **Model Evaluation:** The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report.

## Steps to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository:**
   
   git clone https://github.com/Adithi13/FakeNews_Classification.git
   
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
      cd Fake-News-Classification

## Results
The model achieved an accuracy of 93.6% on the testing dataset.
